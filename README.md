# graph-node2vec
A repository for the implementation of node2vec!

This repository is based on and is an extension of the implementation of the node2vec algorithm (on Spark) by the creators
of the algorithm as outlined in the following paper:

> node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks.
> Aditya Grover and Jure Leskovec.
> Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2016.
> 

### Building the project
